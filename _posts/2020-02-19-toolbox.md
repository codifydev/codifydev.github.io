# Editor
## Visual Studio Code 

Extensions:
- Remote Development (SSH): this is game changer, not only do you get the text editor, you also get terminal shells and file explorer. No more juggling between Putty/MobaTerm, WinSCP/Samba.
Under the hood this spawns a server on the host. One may face installation issues on older Unix OS, otherwise it's seamless. Note the remote server binary is not open source. 
- Python Interactive: another game changer, this makes it almost seamless developing in sandbox mode and packaging into proper Python scripts/modules. 
I no longer use Jupyter Notebook/Lab with this (I connect to a Jupyter kernel instead). Basically you can develop in a hybrid mode, in which it's a Python script but has the concept of cells. 
Cells are delimited with #%% , pressing Shift+Enter on a cell would automatically spawn the Jupyter interactive window/kernel connection. 
- Vim: of course :)

Tips:
- In a terminal shell, to open a file in the IDE use "code <file>". 'code' is aliased to an agent that forwards the file to current window.

Useful Keybindings:

In the past I wouldn't have guessed Microsoft would create an open-source text editor, times have changed :)

# Dashboard
## Streamlit
This is an amazing tool, I would recommend for rapid time to product. Each widget element is just one line of Python code.
Only limitation is that it's not as flexible and is hesitant on allowing custom HTML/JS code. 
To address customization I believe they would eventually enable plugins.

## Dash by Plotly
Allows creating dashboards with pure Python and basic HTML structure.
Uses React.js for its widgets and allows custom HTML/CSS tweaks.

# ML / Data Science 
## XGBoost, Scikit-Learn
It's just wonderful that XGBoost could directly work with Pandas Dataframes.

# Docker
I've used Docker for AMD ROCM, Jekyll server (Github Pages), ML workspace.
