On efficient model training, a friend and I have coupled model quantization with feedback alignment training algorithms.
The quantization library used was Xilinx Brevitas, while the feedback alignment implementation used was obtained from this repository on Direct Random Target Projection (https://github.com/ChFrenkel/DirectRandomTargetProjection).
I will update this post with details and results on this experiment.
